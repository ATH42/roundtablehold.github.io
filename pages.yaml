# item_links allow 1 checkbox to also check other checkboxes on the site.
# The way this works is the first id in each list affects every id listed after it.
# For example
#  - [id1, id2, id3, id4]
# Whenever id1 is checked all of id2, id3, and id4 will be checked as well.
# But when id2, id3, and id4 are checked nothing else happens.
# The id is constructed like this:
# page[id]_section[num]_item[0]
# So for instance, The Soldier of Godrick is bosses_2_1
