Agree, and you'll literally lose 1 point off your Vigor stat, and the HP that goes with it, in exchange for a consumable called Baldachin's Blessing. Use this consumable at any time to receive a 15 second buff to poise and physical damage negation, after which you also get your point of Vigor back.</label>

He'll advise you on a much safer way into the castle than the bombartment of ballista bolts you'll receive if you go through the gate, but you still get a dialogue choice to agree or disagree. If you ask him to, now or later, he'll open the gate for you, though it's much safer to go the long way around as he advises and open it yourself from inside.</label>

At any time until you kill Godrick, you can kill Gostoc and get those stolen souls back, though of course you end Gostoc's questline early by doing so.

Use it on the Gate that mentions Anticipation. (If you've used the key already on a different Gate, there are two more to find for the other Gates, one in Raya Lucaria and one in Sellia, Town of Sorcery.) This will return you to where the game started. Go through the area, get your revenge, and find the Stormhawk King around the chapel where you first spawned.

Go to Black Knife Catacombs, either by finding it on your own, or by getting some cuddles with Fia after that conversation with Rogier: you should newly be able to ask her about the Black Knifeprint, and she'll share some knowledge about it and hand you a minimap as a location clue. Either way, fight the dungeon's secret second boss, a Black Knife Assassin. It'll drop the Black Knifeprint.</label>

Warp to Roundtable Hold again, even from within it, and he'll be dead, leaving behind his Bell Bearing, his entire outfit, and a letter, which goes into the Info tab of your inventory and gives you a hint regarding D's questline.

Varre says to wait because he hopes for "Luminary" Mohg to become king and for you to meet him as such. On a metatextual level, the devs had him say that because Mohgwyn Palace is a VERY hard area that dumps you right in front of the Mohg boss fight, all best left for much later than Liurnia.
