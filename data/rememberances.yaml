      - [1, "Weeping Peninsula", "In the western area past the Church of Pilgrimage."]
      - [2, "Liurnia of the Lakes", "Northeast of Raya Lucaria, in the waters in front of Raya Lucaria Crystal Tunnel Grace. To access this Walking Mausoleum you must travel directly west of the tunnel entrance. Then you need to use the spirit spring to jump onto the Mausoleum when it walks close enough to the cliff wall. You can experiment with the spirit spring jump and also double jump with Torrent after using the spring and take no fall damage. Once on top of the Mausoleum, knock off enough skull piles to subdue it. The Mausoleum may not move at night time."]

      - [5, "Consecrated Snowfield", "Northwest of Ordina, next to the Apostate Derelict Grace. <b>Warning - This one fires magical artillery into the air, bombarding the surroundings until it is subdued.</b>"]
      - [6, "Deeproot Depths", "Near the The Nameless Eternal City Grace. Can be jumped upon by climbing on the roots in the area, then you must destroy skulls on the top of the Mausoleum instead of the feet."]
