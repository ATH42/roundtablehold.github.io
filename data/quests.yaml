Follow the ramparts across a narrower section and slash at a pile of boxes on the left side, where you'll find a ladder poking up.

As soon as you light the Site of Grace, he'll invade your world as Edgar the Revenger and try to kill you. Defeat him for his Banished Knight's Halberd +8 and a Shabriri Grape for Hyetta. This invasion happens even if you didn't do the rest of his questline at all, and, even more wildly, even if you killed him at one of his previous locations."]

Use this consumable at any time to receive a 15 second buff to poise and physical damage negation, after which you also get your point of Vigor back."]
      - [2, "", "While cuddling with her, sometimes it ends automatically after a few seconds, but sometimes you stay and get a prompt to talk to her. Use \"Talk in secret\" to learn more about her.

      - [7, "", "Bring it to her and she'll give you a Radiant Baldachin's Blessing, similar to the standard variant without the HP penalty. Exhaust her dialogue and rest, and like Rogier, she'll have fallen asleep.

If you ask him to, now or later, he'll open the gate for you, though it's much safer to go the long way around as he advises and open it yourself from inside."]
      - [2, "", "As you progress either path, Gostoc will secretly be close behind. You may notice that while in Stormveil Castle, if you die and then retrieve your runes, you don't get them all back - Gostoc steals 30% from every retrieval you drop in the castle. At any time until you kill Godrick, you can kill Gostoc and get those stolen souls back, though of course you end Gostoc's questline early by doing so. Killing Godrick makes them lost forever."]
      - [3, "", "At a few different points as you explore Stormveil, you can actually catch him sneaking around behind you. He's hard to spot, but the wiki reports that you can find him \"on a ruined watchtower on the side path, inside the rampart tower, and on the castle chapel roof, above Sorcerer Rogier.\" Optionally find and speak to him at one of these spots, and he'll give you a Grace Mimic for the trouble."]

      - [3, "", "Go back to Sellen. Then head to Sellian Hideaway in North Caelid past the seals in Sellia and North of the Church of the Plague Grace. It is hidden behind an Illusory wall behind a giant gravestone."]
      - [4, "", "Go through Sellia Hideaway and at the bottom you will find a seal guarded by a sorceror. Kill him and open the seal then talk to Master Lusat and defeat Radahn in Redmane Castle then return to Sellen."]
      - [5, "", "Head to Witchbane Ruins, South of the Fourth Church of Marika in West Weeping Peninsula, South of Limgrave, and talk to her."]

    num: 8
    items:
      - [1, "", "Found just outside the starting area, talk to him then return to talk after unlocking Roundtable Hold. Return to his location after killing Godrick to find a message."]
      - [2, "", "Go to the Rose Church located on an island in the South-West area of Liurnia Lake. Talk to him for Festering Bloody Fingers then perform 3 Invasions, outcome doesn't matter, and talk to him again for a Lord of Blood's Favor."]
      - [3, "", "Next go to the Church of Inhibition in the North-East section of Liurnia and interact with the corpse of the maiden in the chair. Return to Varre to get a reusable Blood Finger for Unlimited Invasions and a Pureblood Knight's Medal that he says to use \"when the time is right.\""]
      - [4, "", "Can be fought as an invader in Mohgwyn's Palace."]
      - [6, "", "Notes: There are multiple alternatives to the Church of Inhibition, it's just the easiest. There is no \"right time\" to use the medal; you can use it instantly and it will warp you to the steps of Mohgwyn Palace. Varre says to wait because he hopes for \"Luminary\" Mohg to become king and for you to meet him as such. On a metatextual level, the devs had him say that because Mohgwyn Palace is a VERY hard area that dumps you right in front of the Mohg boss fight, all best left for much later than Liurnia. Use the medal when you're ready, or if you just want to grab the nearby Dynasty Mausoleum Entrance Site of Grace and dip out."]
